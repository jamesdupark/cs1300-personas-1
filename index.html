      <h2>My Interface: Utensil dispenser</h2>
      <p>
        The interface I chose to examine was a utensil dispenser located at the
        ERC.

        <h2>User Observations</h2>
        <p>
          After observing users interact with the utensil dispenser, I noticed 
          these overarching themes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In terms of <b>which utensils</b> are taken, forks are the most
            popular by a large margin, followed by knives and then spoons.
          </li>
          <li>
            In terms of <b>quantity of utensils</b>, most users took only one item
            of a given type, and one at a time. Some users did take multiple
            utensils, but usually of different types (i.e. a fork and a knife
            rather than two forks).
          </li>
          <li>
            In terms of the <b>timing of interactions</b>, most interactions with
            the interface did not last more than a second (simply pulling out the
            desired utensil and leaving.) Interactions that lasted longer than
            that were usually due to taking multiple utensils, since there is a
            delay when taking more than one utensil. This delay is especially
            notable when taking multiple of the same utensil, since the next
            utensil has to fall down before it can be taken. Thus, the area around
            the interface remained relatively clear even though there was high
            traffic flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            In terms of <b>how users interacted with the interface</b>, most 
            people used one hand to operate it, since many were holding other 
            things in their other hand (i.e. ERC muffins and other pastries). The
            notable exception was when people would take multiple utensils, 
            occasionally both hands would be used.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>User Interview Questions</h2>
          <p>I used the following questions to interview my users:</p>
          <ol id="questions-list">
            <li>Have you used this dispenser in the past?</li>
            <li>Describe the purpose of this dispenser.</li>
            <li>Describe how you use this dispenser.</li>
            <li>What did you need utensils for today? What about typically?</li>
            <li>on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being not at all intuitive and 5 being extremely intuitive, how intuitive would you rate this dispenser as being? Could you elaborate on [your answer]?</li>
            <li>[if used before:] Can you think of a time when you struggled to use the dispenser? What didn't go as expected?</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="interview-answers" class="two-col">
          <h2>User Interview Insights</h2>
          <p>
            For each of the questions, here are the general conclusions I was
            able to draw:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>All interviewees had used the dispenser before.</li>
            <li>
              All interviewees essentially talked about the purpose being to
              easily dispense plastic utensils.
            </li>
            <li>
              All interviewees described the process of using the interface as a
              simple pulling or yanking of the handle hanging out of the
              dispenser.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some interesting responses were:
              <ul>
                <li>one user reported that they needed a knife to cut a mango</li>
                <li>users reported that they typically used utensils to accompany the food that they bought at the erc caf√©, particularly muffins</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>one user noted not wanting to get their fingers dirty when working and eating pastries at the same time</li>
                  <li>another user noted not always wanting certain parts of the sandwiches they bought</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  one user was collecting utensils to bring back and use at home - they regularly resupplied a stock of disposable
                  utensils to use in their dorm.
              </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The three scores given were 5, 4, and 5. Generally, there was agreement that the interface was pretty intuitive.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  one user touched upon the idea of affordances (not explicitly) - mentioned that having the utensil handles hanging out
                  like that lends itself to pulling on them
                </li>
                <li>
                  another user said they preferred the style of dispenser where you press a lever or button, since it feels more
                  interactive/natural to them. They mentioned straw dispensers as an example of such an interface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A user rated 4 instead of 5 because they said they couldn't conceptualize how the dispenser works, since it's not
                    possible to see how the dispenser works. In other words, they couldn't form a good mental model of how the interface
                    was designed.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Most users said no to this question initially, but came up with incidents upon further prompting, indicating that although
              such incidents are not frequent, they do happen.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Some users mentioned times when they wanted to acquire multiple/many utensils for a group activity/for friends and that they
                  struggled to rapidly obtain multiple utensils of the same type
                </li>
                <li>
                  one user mentioned having the interface jam because multiple utensils entered the slot at the same time. This made it
                  significantly harder to use the interface because they had to pull really hard to get both utensils out at once
                </li>
                <li>
                  another user mentioned that sometimes they miss the handle or don't pull hard enough, especially if they are in a hurry
                  or are holding other things (i.e. takeout container)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lastly, one user mentioned using a similar device when there was high traffic and sometimes finding that there were not
                  utensils of a given variety. They also mentioned learning that they could pull the little handle under each dispenser
                  opening to force a new utensil to drop.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Personas</h2>
          <p>I created the following personas based on the observations and interviews:</p>

          <p>Finally, I created the following storyboard based off of Hoarding Harry's experience using the interface.</p>
